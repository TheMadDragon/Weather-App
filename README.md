# Weather-App
The Weather App project is a web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display current weather conditions and forecasts for a particular region after retrieving weather data from a weather API. Users may keep up to date on the weather in their selected area thanks to the real-time weather information it offers.

Based on the user's input location, the Weather App uses an API (in this case, the WeatherAPI) to obtain weather information. The programme dynamically retrieves the forecast for the forthcoming days as well as the current weather data. The information is then presented in a straightforward manner, making it simple for people to comprehend and interpret.
