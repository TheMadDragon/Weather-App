# Weather-App
The Weather App project is a web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display current weather conditions and forecasts for a particular region after retrieving weather data from a weather API. Users may keep up to date on the weather in their selected area thanks to the real-time weather information it offers.
